# JaiTools

Syntax, autocompletion, and Goto Symbol/Anything for the Jai language in Sublime Text 3.

As you may know, this language is not officially released yet, but the demonstrations that Jonathan Blow and Abner Coimbre have shown have been very promising, so the purpose of this package is to help people hit the ground running when the language is released.

Currently features are fully-functioning assuming the language's syntax doesn't change, and I plan to implement integration with Sublime Text's build system in order to support in-code errors and warnings.
